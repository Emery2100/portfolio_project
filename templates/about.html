        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>
            I am an aspiring <strong>Software Engineer</strong> with experience across a wide range of programming
            languages and a strong drive to keep learning and improving my craft.
        </p>

        <p>
            Currently, I work as an <strong>Internet Sales Manager</strong> at a car dealership, where I've built
            excellent communication skills, attention to detail, and the ability to problem-solve in fast-paced environments.
        </p>

        <p>
            Before my transition into tech, I proudly served as a <strong>Combat Engineer</strong> in the U.S. Army. This experience
            shaped my discipline, resilience, and commitment to overcoming challenges — qualities that fuel my growth
            as a developer.
        </p>

        <p>
            Combining technical curiosity, military discipline, and strong customer-focused communication,
            I bring a unique perspective to every project and continue striving toward becoming the best software engineer I can be.
        </p>
